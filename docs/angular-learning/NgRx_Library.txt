		Ng-Rx
	============

NgRx is a framework for building reactive applications in Angular. 
It is a state management library that provides a way to manage application state 
in a predictable and scalable way

NgRx is based on the Redux pattern, which provides a way to manage state in a single, 
immutable data store. 
This data store, called the store, is managed by a set of reducers, 
which handle actions that describe state changes

1. @ngrx/store: A library for managing application state in a single store
2. @ngrx/effects: A library for managing side effects, 
	such as making HTTP requests or accessing the browser's local storage
3. @ngrx/router-store: A library for managing router state in the store
4. @ngrx/entity: A library for simplifying the management of collections of entities in the store

To Install Ng-Rx

>npm install @ngrx/store
