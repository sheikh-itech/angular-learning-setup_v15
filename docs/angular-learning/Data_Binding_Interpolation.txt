Data_Binding_Interpolation
==========================

Data binding is one of the most important features of Angular that allows 
to establish a communication between your component and the view

4 types of data binding
-----------------------

	1. Interpolation
	2. Property binding
	3. Event binding
	4. Two-way binding

Interpolation & Property binding=> Used to display data from Component to View
Event binding=> Used to handle user interactions and update Component's state [clicks, inputs etc]
Two-way binding=> Combines both Property & Event-Binding to update Component & View in same time

[()]=> Syntax to bind any property for 2 Way Binding
