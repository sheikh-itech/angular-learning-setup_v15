			Angular Services
		============================

A service is a class that can be injected into other components or services to provide common functionality or data

Services are typically used to encapsulate business logic, data access, or other shared functionality that multiple components might need to use

Create a service class
======================

1. Create a new class and decorate it with the @Injectable decorator
2. Decorator tells that class is a service that can be injected into other Components/Services

Register the service
====================
=>To make the service available for injection, need to register it with Angular
=>To register add it to providers array of NgModule decorator

Inject the service
==================
To use the service in a component/ another service-
Need to Import/Inject it into constructor of that Component/Service


import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class MyService {
  // service code goes here
}

---------------------------------------------
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { MyService } from './my-service';

@NgModule({
  providers: [MyService],
})
export class RootModule { }

---------------------------------------------
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { MyService } from './my-service';

@Component({
  selector: 'my-component',
  template: '<p>My name is {{name}}.</p>'
})
export class MyComponent {
  name: string;

  constructor(private myService: MyService) {
    this.name = this.myService.getName();
  }
}
