		@HostBinding
	---------------------

@HostBinding() is an Angular decorator that:

		Binds a property or class of the host element to a component or directive property
		Allows you to dynamically set styles, classes, and attributes on the host element
		Eliminates the need for manual DOM manipulations like ElementRef or Renderer2


Syntax and Usage
----------------
@HostBinding('class.active') isActive = true;      // Binds to class
@HostBinding('attr.role') role = 'button';          // Binds to attribute
@HostBinding('style.color') color = 'blue';         // Binds to style


Parameters:

	'class.active' → Binds the active class to the host element
	'attr.role' → Binds the role attribute to the host element
	'style.color' → Binds the color style dynamically

Use Case
--------
	Dynamically changing the appearance or behavior of the host element
	Avoids manual DOM manipulation and keeps the template clean


When Should You Use @HostBinding()?
-----------------------------------
		Want to dynamically apply classes, attributes, or styles to the host element
		Want to bind host properties in a directive
		Want to avoid using ElementRef and Renderer2 for performance reasons
		When you need a clean and declarative way to interact with the host element
