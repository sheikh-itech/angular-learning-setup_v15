		NgContainer
	------------------

The <ng-container> is an Angular structural directive element that acts as a logical container in the DOM

	=> It does not render in the DOM, making it invisible in the HTML output
	=> It helps group multiple structural directives
	=> It helps conditional rendering without introducing unnecessary HTML elements


Apply multiple *ngIf, *ngFor, *ngSwitch, etc., without wrapping them in extra div or span


	<ng-container *ngIf="show">
		<p>This content is conditionally rendered</p>
	</ng-container>


=> The <ng-container> itself wonâ€™t appear in the DOM
=> Only the <p> tag will be rendered when the condition is true
