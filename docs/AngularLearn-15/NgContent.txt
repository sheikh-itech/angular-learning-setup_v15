		NgContent
	----------------

The ng-content directive in Angular is used for content projection, 
which allows you to insert dynamic content from a parent component into a child component

=> It acts as a placeholder in the child component where the parent component's content will be injected
=> This enables reusability and flexibility by allowing you to create components with customizable content
=> Makes the child component flexible and reusable
=> The projected content retains the parent component’s styles, not the child’s
=> To apply child component styles, use Angular’s ::ng-deep or ViewEncapsulation.None

Why Use ng-content?
-------------------

Dynamic Content Injection: You can pass HTML content or other components into a child component
Reusable Components: Create flexible and reusable components with dynamic content slots
Encapsulation: The projected content retains the parent component’s styles
Multiple Projection Slots: You can project content into specific areas of the child component


Syntax
------
<ng-content></ng-content>

	=> Acts as a placeholder where the projected content will appear
	=> The parent component defines the content to be inserted into the child component


Real-World Use Cases
--------------------
Reusable UI Components:
	Create reusable components like cards, panels, or modals with customizable content

Dynamic Layouts:
	Use multi-slot projection for complex layouts with different sections

Lazy Loading & Conditional Rendering:
	Combine with *ngIf or *ngSwitch to conditionally render projected content

Dynamic Styling:
	Add classes or styles dynamically to projected content
