		@HostListener
	---------------------

@HostListener is a decorator in Angular that listens to DOM events on the host element and triggers a method 
when the event occurs.

It allows to handle user interactions directly inside a directive or component

	=> @HostListener binds a component or directive method to a DOM event on the host element


@HostListener(eventName: string, args?: string[])

		eventName: The name of the DOM event (e.g., 'click', 'mouseenter')
		args (optional): Additional event arguments (e.g., $event for event details)



Features
========

	Simplifies event binding – No need for manual addEventListener.
	Encapsulated logic – Keeps event handling within the directive/component.
	Works on host elements – Applies events to the component or directive itself


Use Cases
=========

Handling Click Outside an Element:
			Close a dropdown when clicking outside

Listening for Keyboard Events:
			Detect Escape key presses to close modals
			
Detecting Scroll Events:
			Load more content on scroll
			
Monitoring Window Resizing:
			Adjust UI dynamically based on screen size


Drawbacks
=========
Only works on the host element
Can lead to performance issues – If used excessively
No automatic cleanup – Unlike Renderer2, Angular doesn’t remove event listeners automatically
