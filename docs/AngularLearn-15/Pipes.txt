		Pipes
	------------

Pipes in Angular are a feature that allow you to transform data in your application before displaying it to the user

Pipes are used
--------------
	1. format
	2. filter
	3. sort data 

They can be used with 'template-driven', 'reactive forms', as well as with other Angular 'Components' & 'Services'

Pure pipes are designed to be stateless, 
meaning that they donâ€™t have any internal state that could affect their output

Improves performance of Angular application

  pure: true
})
