Data Binding In Angular
=======================
Data binding in Angular allows communication between the component (TypeScript) and the template (HTML)
There are four main types of data binding in Angular:

	1. Interpolation		{{ property }}				Displays component data in the template
	
	2. Property Binding		[property]="value"			Binds a property to an HTML attribute
	
	3. Event Binding		(event)="method()"			Calls a method when an event occurs
	
	4. Two-Way Binding		[(ngModel)]="property"		Syncs input field with component property
