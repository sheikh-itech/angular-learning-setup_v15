		Angular Interceptor
	---------------------------

Angular HTTP Interceptors are a powerful feature that allows you to intercept, modify, or handle HTTP requests 
and responses globally before they are sent to the server or received by the application


Use Cases of Interceptors
-------------------------

Add Authorization Tokens → Attach authentication tokens to every request.

Global Error Handling → Handle errors globally.

Modify HTTP Headers → Add, remove, or modify HTTP headers.

Loading Spinner → Display a loader/spinner while requests are being processed.

Caching → Cache responses to reduce redundant API calls.

Request/Response Logging → Log all requests and responses for debugging.



		@Injectable()
		export class HttpInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {

			intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {

				console.log('Intercepted Request:', req);

				const modifiedReq = req.clone({
					headers: req.headers.set('Authorization', 'Bearer YOUR-TOKEN-HERE')
				});

				return next.handle(modifiedReq);
			}
		}
