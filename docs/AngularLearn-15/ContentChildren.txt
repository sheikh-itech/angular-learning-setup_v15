		@ContentChildren
	------------------------

@ContentChildren() is an Angular decorator used to:

		Query multiple projected child elements or components inside a parent component

		Retrieve a QueryList of child elements, making it easy to iterate, modify, or interact with them collectively

		Used when working with dynamic and flexible content projection scenarios, such as lists, tabs, or accordions


Syntax
------
@ContentChildren(ChildComponent, { descendants: true }) children!: QueryList<ChildComponent>;

	ChildComponent → The class or directive you want to query
	descendants: true → Includes nested children inside other components


When Should You Use @ContentChildren()?
=======================================
	When you need to query and iterate over multiple projected children
	When creating list-based components, such as:
			Tabs or accordions
			Multiple dynamic sections (e.g., collapsible panels)
			Grouped forms or custom table rows
	When applying dynamic behavior to all projected children (e.g., adding classes, toggling visibility)



Key Features of @ContentChildren()
----------------------------------

Query Multiple Children
	Unlike @ContentChild(), @ContentChildren() lets you query multiple projected children using QueryList

Live Updates with QueryList
	The QueryList returned by @ContentChildren() is live, meaning it automatically updates if children change

Filter Using Descendants
	{ descendants: true } → Includes children of children in the query
	{ descendants: false } → Only includes direct children
