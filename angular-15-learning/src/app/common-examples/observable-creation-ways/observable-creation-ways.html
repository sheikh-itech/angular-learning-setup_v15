    1. Manual Creation-     new Observable()

        We can manually create an Observable by instantiating it using the Observable constructor
        Gives us full control over the emission and completion logic

        customObservable1 = new Observable(observer => &#123;
            observer.next('First Value');    // Emit value
            observer.next('Second Value');
    
            setTimeout(() => &#123;
                observer.next('Third Value');
                observer.complete();         // Complete the stream
            &#125;, 2000);
    
            return () => console.log('Observable Unsubscribed!');
        &#125;);

    
    2. Emit a Sequence of Values-   of()
        
        The of() operator creates an Observable that emits,
        a fixed set of values and completes immediately.

        Ideal for emitting static values

        customObservable2 = of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);


    3. Convert Iterable or Promise to Observable-       from()
        
        The from() operator converts arrays, promises, or iterable objects into Observables

        customObservable3 = from([10, 20, 30, 40]);


    4. Observable with Promise-     new Promise(...)

        promise = new Promise((resolve) => &#123;
            setTimeout(() => resolve('Resolved Promise!'), 2000);
        &#125;);
        
        customObservable4 = from(this.promise);


    5. Observable with Intervals-       interval()

        The interval() operator creates an Observable that emits values at a regular time interval
        It never completes automatically

        customObservable5 = interval(1000).pipe(take(5));  // Emit 5 values at 1s intervals


    6. Observable with Timer-       timer()

        The timer() operator creates an Observable that emits a value after a delay and 
        can optionally emit repeatedly.

        Perfect for delayed execution or interval emissions

        customObservable6 = timer(2000, 1000).pipe(take(5));  // Start after 2s, emit every 1s


    7. Emit a Sequence of Numbers-      range()

        The range() operator emits a sequence of numbers over a specified range

        customObservable6 = timer(2000, 1000).pipe(take(5));  // Start after 2s, emit every 1s


    8. Emits Nothing and Completes Immediately-     empty()

        The empty() operator creates an Observable that emits no items and immediately completes

        customObservable8 = EMPTY;


    9. Emits an Error and Completes-        throwError()
        
        The throwError() operator creates an Observable that emits an error immediately

        customObservable9 = throwError(() => new Error('Something went wrong!'));


    10. Creates an Observable at Subscription Time-     defer()

        The defer() operator creates a new Observable for each subscriber, 
        ensuring a fresh value is generated

        customObservable10 = defer(() => of(Math.random()));
