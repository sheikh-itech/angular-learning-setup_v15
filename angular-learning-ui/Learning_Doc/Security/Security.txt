		Angular Security
	-------------------------
	
Angular provides several security features out of the box.
Here are some of the key security features in Angular


1. Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection
----------------------------------------
Angular automatically sanitizes user input to protect against XSS attacks.

2. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection
-----------------------------------------------
Angular provides built-in support for CSRF protection. Angular adds an XSRF token to every HTTP request that it sends, which the server can use to verify that the request came from an authorized source.

3. Content Security Policy (CSP) support
----------------------------------------
Angular supports CSP, which is a security feature that restricts the types of content that a web page can load. CSP can help prevent cross-site scripting attacks.

4. Authentication and authorization
-----------------------------------
Angular provides built-in support for authentication and authorization. Angular's built-in authentication and authorization support is based on JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are a secure way to transmit information between parties.

5. Input validation
-------------------
Angular provides built-in input validation to help protect against injection attacks. Angular can automatically validate user input and prevent malicious input from being processed.

6. HTTP interceptor
-------------------
Angular provides HTTP interceptors, which can be used to add security features to HTTP requests. For example, you can use an HTTP interceptor to add an authorization header to every HTTP request that your application sends.

7. Secure coding practices
--------------------------
Angular encourages secure coding practices such as using HTTPS, using strong passwords, and avoiding insecure coding practices such as eval().
