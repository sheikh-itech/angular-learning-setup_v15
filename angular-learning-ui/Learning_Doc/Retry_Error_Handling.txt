		Error Handling & Retry
	===============================

The HttpClient service provides a range of error handling and retry mechanisms 
that can be used to deal with errors in a more robust way

The 'catchError' operator can be used to handle HTTP errors and provide a fallback response or 
perform some other action


Re-Try
------
The 'retry' operator can be used to retry an HTTP request a certain number of times in case of an error

this.http.get('/api/data').pipe(
  retry(3)
).subscribe((response) => {
  console.log(response);
}, (error) => {
  console.log(error);
});


Retry takes a number that specifies how many times to retry the request.
If the request fails, it will be retried up to three times before returning an error

The HttpClient service provides many other options for handling errors and retrying requests

Retry-When
----------
we'rWe can also use the retryWhen operator to retry failed HTTP requests.
Using the delayWhen operator to add an increasing delay between each retry, 
and the takeWhile operator to limit the number of retries based on the error status code
