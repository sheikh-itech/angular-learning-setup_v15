		ProvidedIn
	=================

The providedIn property in Angular is used to register a service with a specific module or injector
It tells Angular where to provide the service

If we register any Service as a provider in the RootModule using the providers array then 
Therefore, the providedIn property is not needed for this service


The SharedModule and make it available to all components and services in that module

@Injectable({
  providedIn: SharedModule
})
export class UserListService {
  // ...
}
